BlackJack V1.1
By Dominykas Jucys

The previous GitHub repository has been deleted, due to it being made when I knew little about GitHub
meaning that the file structure and such was an absolute mess. Nonetheless, the code from there will be 
copied over here, in the hopes of showing off the very first version of my BlackJack game.
