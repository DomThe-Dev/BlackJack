# BlackJack
This is a project worked on by yours truly, in C++. It serves as a way to show my progress in C++, since as I learn more and more, I will be changing the code.

### Documentation
If you want to see the code, it is all displayed here. If you want an explanation of my process, and how my code is structured, look at this [repository's wiki](https://github.com/DomThe-Dev/BlackJack/wiki), where I intend to document the process, and other information.
Any issues should be submitted to the issues tab, and formatted in a similar way to 

### Who Are You?

Whatever it is that you choose to call me, I am an aspiring Game Developer, who loves programming, games, stories, and plenty of other things. If you want to learn more about me, look at my GitHub profile, and you'll see some extra information about me, as well as links to my other public socials.

### Why BlackJack?
I created BlackJack, rather than some other game, because the first full program I ever coded was a game of BlackJack using only the Python knowledge from my second-ever Computer Science class. Although the program was an absolute mess as it was nothing but a load of if statements, and "while true" loops, the others in class loved it. People would play the game, and try to earn as much money as possible.

Since then, whenever I learn a new programming language, I often try and test it by making a simple game of BlackJack, due to the hidden complexity the code can have, which often leads to me getting more used to the language.
